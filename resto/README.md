# Restaurant page

## Goal:
- work with webpack
- create DOM from scratch

## Lessons learned:
- really understand the DOM structure
- Understand the order of execution when creating new nodes
- the import module statement executes the function
    - if you are looking for a node that's to be created, it's not found!
    - use the `mode: development` in your webpack config, much better (still not entirely helpful) error messages
