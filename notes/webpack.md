# webpack

## asset mgmt
webpack helps devs manage the asset files, e.g. moving them form `src` to `dist`.

once upon a time (lol), other tools also existed.

webpack handles many files, not just js

`npm run build`

`webpack.config.js`

other features: code-splitting, lazy-loading, and tree-shaking
